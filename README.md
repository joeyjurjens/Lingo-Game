# Lingo Game

This is a simple six-letter word guesser game.

How it works:
The program will take a random word from a array with a bunch of six-letter words.
The user enters a word, then the program will check if the character of the word, is in the same position of the six-letter word.
If so, it will be shown.


Example:
Word to guess: acting
Users guess: action
Program shows after guess: acti**
