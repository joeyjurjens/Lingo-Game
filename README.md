# Lingo Game

This is a simple six-letter word guesser game.

How it works:
The program will take a random word from a array with a bunch of six-letter words. <br/>
The user enters a word, then the program will check if the character of the word, is in the same position of the six-letter word.


Example: <br/>
<b> Word to guess: </b> acting <br/>
<b> Users guess: </b> action <br/>
<b> Program shows after guess: </b> acti** <br/>
