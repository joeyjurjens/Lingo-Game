# Lingo Game

This is a simple six-letter word guesser game.

How it works:
The program will take a random word from a array with a bunch of six-letter words. <br/>
The user enters a word, then the program will check if the character of the word, is in the same position of the six-letter word.


Example:
Word to guess: acting <br/>
Users guess: action <br/>
Program shows after guess: acti** <br/>
